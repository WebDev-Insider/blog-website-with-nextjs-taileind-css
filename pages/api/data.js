            The OpenJS Foundation today announced the release of Node.js 21,
			the latest release line of the open-source, cross-platform JavaScript
			runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the
			client's browser. It replaces the Node.js 20 line, which is being promoted
			to long-term support (LTS).

           The Foundation manages its releases this way: Major Node.js versions have "Current" 
		   release status for six months. This gives library authors time to add support for them.
		   Node.js 21 will be the Current release until April 2024. The Foundation says that Node.js 21
		   is best for early testers working in specific environments, and it recommends Node.js 20 LTS
		   for production deployments

         If you're interested in getting access to interesting new features early, Node.js 21 is a great
		 way to test and see what's coming," said aid Rafael Gonzaga, Node.js Technical Steering Committee 
		 (TSC) Member, in a statement. "Our release schedule specifically covers this. If you're already in
		 active deployment or if you are planning for it, Node.js 20 and 18 LTS are for you.

            The list of Node.js 21 improvements includes, among others, 
			an update of the V8 JavaScript engine to 11.8, stable WebStreams, 
			a new experimental flag to flip module defaults (--experimental-default-type), 
			and updates to the test runner that allow users to run functional tests and export results. 
			Node.js has two module systems: CommonJS modules and ECMAScript modules. Node.js treats files 
			with a .js extension by default as CommonJS modules. This can now more easily be flipped.

            The company posted revenue of $34.1bn for the third quarter of 2023.
			“We had a good quarter for our community and business,” said Mark Zuckerberg,
			Meta founder and CEO. “I’m proud of the work our teams have done to advance AI
			and mixed reality with the launch of Quest 3, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and our AI studio.”
Discussing how Meta differentiates Threads to Twitter, Meta’s CFO, Susan Li, said: “There are a couple value
 propositions that we are looking at for Threads. One is just the openness.  We’re building a decentralised
 interoperable experience. It’s going to use the ActivityPub social networking protocol, and that means you
 can be followed by people who use our app or other apps like Mastodon. We hope that that’ll give creators and
 our community broader reach beyond just Threads.”
 
             For Li, the second area of differentiation is the experience Meta has gained from its other
			 apps, such as Instagram, to help it build what she described as “a productive and creative 
			 place to have conversations and to share your ideas”, adding: “We’re focused here on community
			 guidelines, providing features to help users control their experience.”
